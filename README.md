# My-Refocus-Assignments.

Hello! I am David a student of Refocus and I want to be a Web Developer.

My hobbies are playing video games and loves to learn about new technologies.

My goal this year is to become a successful Software Engineer.

The reason why I want to become a Web developer, I like to travel while working remotely and in this field I know it is future proof.
